# Some important info for your code

* please follow best practices in terms if coding style
    *  i.e. clear comments, proper indentation.
    * for Python code use pep8 style guidlines: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
* I expect to have one python function that runs the entire arduino routine that controls your part. That would make it a lot easier for me to put everything together.
    * i.e. when you run the python function, a variable gets updated and sent to the arduino, telling the arduino to start motors etc.
* if you have any questions, message me on facebook or via email: mario.zauchner15@imperial.ac.uk
